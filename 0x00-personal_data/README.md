# alx-backend-user-data

## 0x00-personal_data
This project mainly involves logging and encryption of personal data.   
logging - means keeping a record of events that happen when some software is running and we can use those logs to understand the software's behavior while it was running.    
Encryption - is the process of encoding a message or information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it and those who are not authorized cannot.   

## Objectives
- Examples of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- How to implement a log filter that will obfuscate PII fields
- How to encrypt a password and check the validity of an input password
- How to authenticate to a database using environment variables
